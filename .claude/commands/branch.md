You are creating or suggesting a git branch for this repository.

Use Korean.

Branch naming convention:

```text
<git-commit-type>/#<issue-number>-<brief-english-description>
```

Examples:

```text
feat/#123-add-review-api
fix/#346-handle-apple-email-missing
refactor/#354-clean-partnership-period
docs/#12-update-deploy-guide
```

Input from the user:

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

Process:

1. Identify the git commit type.
2. Identify the issue number.
3. Convert the feature/fix summary into short English kebab-case.
4. Check current branch and working tree before creating.
5. If the user only asks for a branch name, suggest the branch name only.
6. If the user explicitly asks to create the branch, run `git switch -c <branch-name>`.

Allowed commit types:

```text
feat, fix, refactor, style, docs, test, chore
```

Rules:

- Always include `#` before the issue number.
- Use lowercase English in the description.
- Use kebab-case, not spaces, underscores, or Korean.
- Keep the description short, usually 2-6 words.
- If the issue number is missing, ask for it before creating a branch.
- If the type is unclear, choose the most conservative type and explain briefly.
- Before creating a branch, run `git status --short` and `git branch --show-current`.
- If there are uncommitted changes, mention that they will remain in the working tree after switching.

Output when suggesting:

```text
추천 브랜치명: feat/#123-add-review-api
```

Output when creating:

```text
생성할 브랜치명: feat/#123-add-review-api
```

Then run:

```bash
git switch -c feat/#123-add-review-api
```
